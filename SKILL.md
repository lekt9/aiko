# /contract

Core job: declare a truth claim, iterate until genuinely satisfied, spawn children when the truth requires sub-work. A contract is the primitive; there is no separate scaffold above it.

## When to invoke

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| "contract this" / "X must always hold" | `contract declare "<plan>" --action "<check>"` |
| "build and run this" | `contract build "<plan>" --action "<check>"` |
| "solve until done" | `contract solve "<plan>" --action "<check>"` |
| "this is a sub-problem of Y" | `contract spawn <parent-id> "<plan>" --action "<check>"` |
| "keep building / drill to completion / finish without asking" | `contract drive <organ-id>` |
| "what contracts exist" | `contract list` or `contract status [<id>]` |
| "is this a recurring pattern?" | `contract search` |
| "convert past patterns" / "don't lose this in the refactor" | `contract import <source>` |

On any invocation: read `ledgers/contracts.jsonl` — it is the only truth. The full verb list (38+) is discoverable via `contract self`; the table above is the load-bearing front door (Ψ2, working-memory cap).


## Architecture (L0-L2)

- **L0 core** — `scripts/lib/contract_core.py`: data model, the only code that touches `ledgers/contracts.jsonl`. `declare()`, `record_iteration()`, `mark_satisfied()`, `get_tree()`, `list_all()`, `children_satisfy()`.
- **L1 CLI** — `scripts/contract`: the verb surface. `declare`, `iterate`, `build`, `spawn`, `solve`, `status`, `list`, `search`, `_mark`. Every verb either writes one ledger row or emits a structured prompt; nothing else.
- **L2 detector** — `scripts/contract-habit-detect.py`: passive related-contract detector. Token overlap against all `plan` fields in the ledger. Surfaces candidates above threshold. Never declares. (Filename retained; the user-facing operation is `contract search` — the contract IS the habit.)

The unifying model: a contract with a mechanical `--action` is a **cell**. `--action agent-judges` is a **judgment**. `--action funnel` (or `children-satisfy`) is a **funnel** (AND-gate). `--action funnel-first` is a **funnel-first** (OR-gate). `--action quorum:<K>` is a **quorum** (the integrate-and-fire neuron — K of N children). `--action sequence` is a **sequence** (an ordered funnel). `--action loop-until:<cmd>` is a **loop** (re-run body each iterate). `--action harness:<path>` is a **harness** (delegates to `<path>/verify.sh`). `--action tool-guard:<glob>` is a **tool-guard** (a PreToolUse hook blocks the matching tool until the contract is satisfied). One data model, nine shapes, infinite fractal depth.

## Modifying the skill vs creating contracts (dev-level routing)

A `/contract` request is one of two kinds. Judge which in-thread; there is
no keyword rule (a regex on the request text would be a forbidden surface).

**Contract-use** (the common case): the request is a truth claim about your
domain. "X must always hold", "build and verify Y", "this should never
happen". Route it through the primitive: `contract declare / build / solve /
iterate`. The skill's own code is not touched.

**Skill-modification** (the dev case): the request is to change the
`/contract` skill's own machinery: fix a bug in the CLI, add a verb, remove
a fallback, change the ledger schema, edit a bundled script. The signal is
that the request names the skill's own surface (a verb, a script, the ledger
format, the CLI's behavior), not a domain fact.

Skill-modification is still done THROUGH the primitive, recursively: declare
a contract whose truth claim is about the skill's own files and whose
`--action` mechanically checks them. Worked example: the contract "the
/contract skill never swallows an error silently" carries `--action python3
scripts/check-no-silent-fallback.py`. You iterate it red, fix the scripts,
iterate it green, mark it satisfied; the contract then stays in the ledger
as a permanent regression guard.

The dev-level test, in one line: **if satisfying the request changes a file
under this skill's own directory, it is skill-modification, and the change
is itself a contract whose action checks this skill's code.** Otherwise it
is ordinary contract-use.

## Default contracts (universal — declare these in any context)

Eleven principles drawn from CLAUDE.md, CONTRACTS.md, and the fruits of the spirit / 10 commandments — mapped only where the translation is genuinely useful and non-redundant. `contract defaults` shows them; `contract search` surfaces existing matches before re-declaring.

**From engineering principles (CLAUDE.md + CONTRACTS.md):**

| # | Plan (abbreviated) | Shape | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "substrate enables, never prescribes — no forbidden surface in any script or agent" | judgment | CLAUDE.md meta-rule |
| 2 | "every commit introduces zero new failures — diff vs baseline is non-positive" | judgment | C-G (no-regression) |
| 3 | "pointer-not-payload — client holds only opaque pointers; all logic lives server-side" | judgment | CLAUDE.md architecture |
| 4 | "harness collects, agent judges — no script emits PROMOTE/PASS/FAIL on its own" | judgment | C-G01 |
| 5 | "verify the served surface, not the source — a build pass is never sufficient" | judgment | C-G06 |
| 6 | "fix root cause, never band-aid — no downstream fix_*/clean_*/patch_* compensator" | judgment | C-G08 |
| 7 | "no mutable .db or state file un-gitignored inside a git-tracked directory" | cell | C-O04 |
| 8 | "auth/deploy chain verified against the live running service; not build, not timestamp" | judgment | cross-harness pattern |

**From fruits of the spirit + commandments (mapped only where genuinely distinct):**

| # | Plan (abbreviated) | Shape | Source / Doctrine |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9  | "serve the genuine need, not just the literal request — technically-passing but intent-missing is fake-green" | judgment | Love (Galatians 5:22) |
| 10 | "one contract, one truth claim — if an action checks two unrelated things it belongs as two contracts" | judgment | No adultery (Commandment 7) |
| 11 | "every verification result traces to a real live source — no synthesized, proxied, or stubbed result; a proxy-green is a false witness" | judgment | No false witness (Commandment 9) |

**Rejected mappings (forces or overlaps):** Joy/Kindness/Goodness/Gentleness (too abstract or not a gate), Self-control/Patience/Faithfulness (already in two-key exit or C-G13), No other gods/No idols/Name in vain/Honor parents/No murder/No stealing/No coveting (all overlap existing defaults 1-8).

Project-specific rules (no `vercel.json`, no `h-screen`, no `#000/#fff`) do NOT belong here.


## How to actually use this (working loop)

**Self-drive is the default.** Every top-level `contract declare` / `solve` /
`build` auto-arms self-drive on the top-level contract (opt out with
`--no-drive`); a child (`--parent` set) never arms — the organ owns the drive.
Once armed, a `/contract` invocation converges the WHOLE tree in-thread without
a human prompt between iterations. Agent judging (KEY 2) is done in-thread and
is NOT a turn boundary — `iterate` → judge → `_mark` → next `iterate` is one
continuous turn. Never end a `/contract` turn with a satisfiable contract
pending. The only two reasons to yield: missing credential · irreversible action
not already authorized — and then you run `contract disarm` and name the blocker.
Ambiguous intent is agent-judges: act on the higher-confidence interpretation
when reversible; the ledger row is the rollback point.

Crystallised from real session work, not aspiration:

1. **Search before declaring.** `contract search --context "<plan>"` (or `contract build`) scores the plan against all existing contracts. Read the candidates; judge in-thread whether to reuse or iterate an existing one before creating new.
2. **Declare with a real check.** `contract declare "<plan>" --action "<shell cmd>"`. The action is the verify gate. A contract without a check is a wish.
3. **Iterate one wave at a time.** `contract iterate <id>` runs the action, appends one ledger row, prints the two-key exit prompt. Read the row; judge whether the machine result is genuine before marking satisfied.
4. **Spawn when sub-work emerges.** `contract spawn <parent> "<sub>" --action "<check>"`. The parent becomes an organ; its satisfaction = all children satisfied. The spawn verb emits a SPAWN REQUIRED prompt — the agent routes the child via a sub-agent or directly.
5. **Mark satisfied.** Call `contract _mark <id> satisfied` directly. No ceremony tag required — the `_mark` event IS the verdict. (Older sessions emitted `<promise>CONTRACT_SATISFIED:<id></promise>` first; that ritual is retired.)
6. **Ledger is memory.** Every failed wave is evidence. Never delete rows; the history drives related-contract surfacing and informs future declares.
7. **Drive the whole tree in one invocation.** When the user invokes `/contract`, converge the entire organ that invocation declares: iterate and mark every child and the organ itself before yielding. Never end a `/contract` invocation with a satisfiable contract left pending, and never hand the loop back to the user mid-tree. The user says `/contract` once; you drive it to a satisfied organ, or to a genuinely-blocked HOLD with the blocker named. For long autonomous runs, `contract drive <organ-id>` removes the between-iteration pause entirely.

## CLI

```bash
# Declare a cell (mechanical check)
contract declare "<plan>" --action "<shell cmd>" [--parent <id>]        # cell
contract declare "<plan>" --action "funnel" [--parent <id>]             # funnel (AND-gate)
contract declare "<plan>" --action "funnel-first" [--parent <id>]       # funnel-first (OR-gate)
contract declare "<plan>" --action "loop-until:<cmd>" [--parent <id>]   # loop
contract declare "<plan>" --action "harness:<path>" [--parent <id>]     # harness
contract declare "<plan>" --action "children-satisfy" [--parent <id>]   # funnel (legacy alias)

# Search similar + declare + first wave (full build cycle)
contract build "<plan>" [--action "<cmd>"]

# Declare + first wave in one call
contract solve "<plan>" --action "<cmd>"

# One iteration wave — two-key exit
contract iterate <id>

# Emit SPAWN REQUIRED for sub-agent routing
contract spawn <parent-id> "<plan>" [--action "<cmd>"]

# Tree view: contract + all descendants
contract status [<id>]

# All contracts
contract list

# Surface related existing contracts (never auto-declares; `habit` kept as back-compat alias)
contract search [--context "<text>"] [--scope project|global]

# Surface past patterns (principle stores, canon, old ledgers) as candidate contracts
contract import <source> [--archive] [--commands]

# Arm autonomous drive loop (Stop hook re-fires after each turn)
contract drive <organ-id>

# Disarm drive loop (use when genuinely stuck or complete)
contract disarm

# Crystallize a learning: memory file + Outline doc
# (also auto-fires on satisfy for any contract declared with --learning)
contract learn "<insight>" [--source <ref>]
```

## Drive mode (autonomous loop, agent-lifecycle agnostic)

`contract drive <organ-id>` arms the contract's own internal hook system to advance the
loop without human prompts and without depending on any specific agent's lifecycle.

**Architecture (self-contained):**

- `~/.contracts/hooks/drive-advance.sh` — internal hook fired by the contract CLI itself
  (after every `iterate` and `_mark`). Writes `~/.contracts/drive_next.txt`.
- `~/.contracts/drive_next.txt` — the portable state file. Agent-agnostic JSON:
  `{"state":"active","organ":"...","resume_cmd":"bash contract iterate <id>","msg":"..."}`
- Survives agent restarts, session ends, runtime switches. Any agent reads this file.

**How it works:**

1. `contract drive <organ-id>` — writes sentinel + seeds `drive_next.txt` synchronously
2. Agent iterates first pending child, judges KEY 2 in-thread
3. After iterate/mark, internal hook fires → updates `drive_next.txt`
4. When agent turn ends, the transport for the current runtime fires:
   - Claude Code: Stop hook reads `drive_next.txt` → `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}`
   - Any agent: SessionStart hook (`contract-session-start.sh`) reads `drive_next.txt` on next session
   - Other runtimes: read `drive_next.txt` directly and inject `resume_cmd`
5. When all children satisfied → `drive_next.txt` writes `state:complete`, sentinel removed

**Wiring for other agents:** Read `~/.contracts/drive_next.txt` at session start; inject
the `msg` field as the first user message. That is the entire integration surface.

**When the agent MUST disarm and ask:**
- Missing credential or auth that can't be derived from the repo
- A destructive/irreversible action not already authorized

**Ambiguous intent is NOT a disarm condition.** When the agent self-judges that
two interpretations are both plausible AND both are reversible, pick the higher-
confidence path and act — the ledger row is the rollback point if the agent's
read was wrong. Only disarm when the cost of guessing wrong is genuinely
irreversible (data loss, deploy, external publication) or unrecoverable without
the user.

**Drive mode and the two-key exit:** KEY 2 is still agent-judged in-thread. Drive mode
removes the "wait for user" pause between iterations, not the judgment itself. The agent
can still judge HOLD when a result is fake-green, or disarm when genuinely blocked.

**State files:**
- `~/.contracts/.drive_active` — contains organ ID (sentinel)
- `~/.contracts/drive_next.txt` — current pending action JSON
- Both removed by `contract disarm`

## Crystallizing learnings (memory + Outline)

A contract is a unit of learning (`CONTRACTING_IS_LEARNING`). When a learning
crystallizes, the skill makes it durable on two surfaces beyond the ledger:

1. a **memory file** in the Claude Code auto-memory folder (survives in session recall)
2. an **Outline document** at `docs.getfoundry.app` (the team knowledge base)

This is a **hook-like structure native to /contract** — it rides the same
internal hook bus as `drive-advance` (`_fire_contract_hooks`, fired by the CLI
itself on every `iterate` and `mark`). Two entry points:

- **Automatic** — declare a contract with `--learning "<insight>"`. When that
  contract is marked satisfied, the `crystallize-learning` hook
  (`~/.contracts/hooks/crystallize-learning.py`) fires on the `mark` event and
  crystallizes it. The hook is self-guarded: a non-satisfied contract, a
  contract with no `learning`, or an already-crystallized one is a no-op.
- **On demand** — `contract learn "<insight>" [--source <ref>]` crystallizes an
  explicit insight immediately and appends a `learned` ledger row.

```bash
contract declare "<plan>" --action "<cmd>" --learning "<insight>"   # auto-crystallize on satisfy
contract learn "<insight>" [--source <ref>]                         # crystallize on demand
```

Every crystallization appends a `crystallized` ledger row — the idempotency
key, so a learning is crystallized at most once. Both surfaces are best-effort
and independent: the memory file is always written; the Outline push is
skipped cleanly when `~/.config/outline/` is absent or
`CONTRACT_CRYSTALLIZE_NO_OUTLINE=1` is set. The substrate emits the artifacts;
it never judges them — the agent reads the memory and the doc.


## Output mode (load-bearing)

Per invocation this skill produces one of:

- **One ledger row** appended to `ledgers/contracts.jsonl` with event type, id, plan, action, wave, exit code, and timestamp. One row per declare; one row per iterate; one row per satisfied mark.
- **A SPAWN REQUIRED prompt** (from `contract spawn`) — a structured block telling the agent to route the child contract via a sub-agent. No ledger write; the child's row is written when the sub-agent runs `contract declare`.
- **A BUILD REQUIRED prompt** (from `contract build`) — search results plus the first iterate output. The agent sees similar contracts and the first wave result in one shot.
- **A tree view** (from `contract status`) — the contract and all descendants, each annotated with shape and status.

Never: a silent ledger write with no agent prompt; a synthetic pass verdict; a wave that doesn't print the two-key exit block.

## The nine shapes (one data model)

Every contract is simultaneously a funnel, a loop, and a harness — fractally. A loop's body can be a funnel; a funnel's children can be loops; a harness wraps any shape. The recursion bottoms out at a cell or judgment.

| Shape | `action` field | Satisfied when |
|---|---|---|
| **cell** | shell command | action exits 0 AND agent judges genuine |
| **judgment** | `agent-judges` | agent confirms in-thread |
| **funnel** | `funnel` or `children-satisfy` | ALL children satisfied (AND-gate) |
| **funnel-first** | `funnel-first` | ANY child satisfied (OR-gate) |
| **loop** | `loop-until:<body-action>` | body exits 0 AND agent judges genuine; re-iterate to advance |
| **harness** | `harness:<path>` | `<path>/verify.sh` exits 0 AND agent judges genuine |
| **tool-guard** | `tool-guard:<glob>` | a standing guard — a PreToolUse hook blocks every tool matching the glob until the contract is satisfied (which lifts it) |
| **sequence** | `sequence` | an ordered funnel — satisfied when every child is satisfied; iterate names the next unsatisfied child in declared order as the current stage |
| **quorum** | `quorum:<K>` | the integrate-and-fire neuron — satisfied when at least K of N children are satisfied; funnel is K=N, funnel-first is K=1 |

Fractal: funnels contain loops, loops contain funnels, harnesses wrap any shape. Every contract is itself a funnel (narrows to truth) + loop (iterate until resolved) + harness (collects evidence). `children-satisfy` remains valid; `funnel` is the canonical name. `drive` mode removes the human pause between loop iterations but does not change the two-key exit.

### Shape IS the type system (no `--lifetime` flag will ever exist)

The nine shapes ARE the lifetime / role / decay model. There is no separate
typed-tag layer and there never will be. Concretely:

| If you would reach for… | …use this shape instead |
|---|---|
| `--lifetime one-shot` (the default) | a plain **cell** or **judgment**. Once `_mark satisfied`, it stays satisfied. |
| `--lifetime invariant` (auto-re-fire) | **`loop-until:<cmd>`**. The body re-runs every iterate; the loop completes when the body says so. The body IS the invariant. |
| `--halflife 7d` (decay/staleness) | re-iterate the cell, or **`verify <surface>`** if it's bound. Staleness = "iterate later"; that's already iterate. Time-based decay would smuggle a clock-judgment into the substrate. |
| `--precondition` vs `--postcondition` | iterate **before** for pre, **after** for post. Direction is the agent's call, not a typed field. |
| `--lifetime capability` | **`tool-guard:<glob>`** — the gate IS the capability. |
| `--lifetime composite` | **`funnel` / `funnel-first` / `sequence` / `quorum`** — the composition IS the lifetime. |

**Discovery is a fix, not a proposal.** When the agent discovers that a
flag/field/layer it is about to add is already provided by an existing
shape, the response is to ship the simplification in the same turn — not
to ask "want me to ship this?". The audit and the fix are one continuous
turn. Asking is a redundant turn that violates the work-style discipline.
Worked example: the "lifetime tag" thread surfaced 2026-05-22 and was
immediately fossilized — `bind_to + verify` was the only genuine new
primitive; the rest was already there. Contract `310f425f`.

## The two-key exit (load-bearing invariant)

Every `contract iterate` ends with:

```
KEY 1 (machine): <action result — PASS | FAIL | AGENT-JUDGES | ERROR>
KEY 2 (agent):   JUDGE — is this GENUINELY satisfied, or fake-green?

If genuine → run: contract _mark <id> satisfied
Otherwise  → fix the target, then: contract iterate <id>
```

No script claims satisfaction. The machine checks; the agent judges. Both keys required.

## Parallel fan-out (heuristic)

When a problem decomposes into N **independent** sub-contracts (their verify gates don't share state), N parallel Agent calls in a single message dispatch faster than serial. It's a heuristic, not a binding rule — sequential dispatch is also fine, especially when N is small or the agent already has the context loaded.

```bash
# Pattern: declare organ then fan-out N children in one parallel message
contract declare "<umbrella plan>" --action "children-satisfy"
# returns <organ-id>

contract fan-out <organ-id> \
  "child plan 1|action1" \
  "child plan 2|action2" \
  "child plan 3|action3"
```

`fan-out` emits a PARALLEL FAN-OUT block with N agent directives. The agent sends them as a single message with N Agent tool calls. Each sub-agent runs `contract solve "<plan>" --action "<cmd>" --parent <organ-id>`.

**When to fan out:** any time the organ has 2+ children whose verify gates do not depend on each other. The agent judges; the CLI surfaces the prompt.

**When NOT to fan out:** sequential dependencies (child B needs child A's artifact), same-file contention (use a worktree), or N=1.

The serial path still works -- `contract spawn` plus sequential iteration -- for dependent work.

## Fractal spawn

When a wave reveals sub-work too large for one fix:

```bash
contract spawn <parent-id> "sub-claim that must hold" [--action "<cmd>"]
```

`spawn` does not write to the ledger. It emits a SPAWN REQUIRED block telling the agent to route the child via a sub-agent (Agent tool) or directly. The child's ledger entry is written when the sub-agent runs `contract declare`. The parent becomes an organ when it has children; its satisfaction = all children satisfied.

## Search (related-contract surfacing)

The contract IS the habit. There is no separate "habit detection" concept — there is only `contract search`, which surfaces existing contracts related to the current context. Every "candidate" it returns is already a contract in the ledger; treat it as a lookup, not a pattern-promotion prompt.

`contract search --context "<text>"` (alias: `contract habit`) scores the context against all existing contract `plan` fields. Surfaces candidates above threshold:

```
RELATED CONTRACTS (threshold=0.55):

  [+] score=0.87  id=<uuid>  status=satisfied
      plan:   verify X always holds ...
      -> contract iterate <id>         # re-satisfy in this session
      -> contract spawn <id> "<sub>"   # delegate sub-work to this parent
```

The detector surfaces. The agent declares. Auto-contracting is a forbidden surface (pattern-match lists prescribing behavior).

## Lifecycle and natural selection

Contracts are not immortal. They are born, they compete, and the less-fit
ones are retired — a natural-selection lifecycle, recorded in the one
append-only ledger.

**Birth with a contradiction check.** Every `declare` runs the search
detector against the new plan and surfaces the past contracts it most
resembles, under a `lifecycle check (natural selection)` block. The
substrate only surfaces; the agent judges in-thread whether the new
contract genuinely **contradicts**, duplicates, or merely refines an
existing one. No script renders the contradiction verdict — a regex on plan
text would be a forbidden surface.

**Selection by supersession.** When two contracts genuinely contradict, the
agent picks the fitter one (newer evidence, broader truth, a real check
versus a wish) and retires the other:

```bash
contract supersede <loser-id> <winner-id> --reason "<why the winner is fitter>"
```

`supersede` (alias: `merge`) appends a `merged` event. The superseded
contract becomes a **fossil**: terminal `merged` status, kept in the ledger
forever, but dropped from `list`, from `search`, and from the declare-time
contradiction surface. A fossil never resurfaces as a reuse candidate —
selection is one-directional.

**Heredity.** The `merged` row carries `merged_into: <winner-id>`, so every
supersession is an edge in the contract DAG. The chain of fossils behind a
living contract is its lineage — the evolutionary record of how that truth
claim was refined. `contract list --show-merged` reveals the fossils.

The ledger is the fossil record: append-only, every superseded contract
preserved as evidence. Natural selection here is variation (the ledger
accumulates contracts), selection (the agent supersedes the less-fit on a
surfaced contradiction), and heredity (the `merged_into` lineage edge).

## The genesis organ (recipe)

The jesus-loop's nine Genesis days are not a separate engine — they are one
contract **organism**, assembled from the shapes above. This is the
canonical arc for a substantial build.

**Step 0 — Plan (discover and reuse by BM25).** Before declaring anything
new, `contract search --context "<the plan>"` ranks every past contract by
BM25 (term-frequency saturation, inverse document frequency, length
normalization) and surfaces the top hits. JUDGE: reuse or iterate an
existing contract before creating a fresh one. The plan stage is a search,
not a blank page. Every `declare` also runs this surface (the lifecycle
check). The root contract's `plan` is the north star.

**Steps 1-6 — Creation (an ordered `sequence`).** Declare the root with
`--action sequence` and spawn the creation stages as ordered children.
Iterating the sequence always names the next unsatisfied stage — Light
before Firmament before Land. Bound a stage's effort with `--budget N`;
iterate then surfaces wave-vs-budget as evidence.

**Step 7 — Verdict.** The two-key exit is the verdict: KEY 1 machine, KEY 2
the agent's PROMOTE / HOLD / REJECT. Recognize genuine convergence and stop;
the two-key exit is final.

**Step 8 — Judgement (the falsifier `audit`).** Before the organism is
satisfied, `contract audit <root> --auditors N` fans out N cold auditors
who each try to break the root contract. The audit organ is satisfied only
when every auditor genuinely failed to falsify it.

**Step 9 — Emergence.** `contract _mark <root> satisfied`. The organism has shipped.

```bash
contract search --context "<plan>"                  # Step 0  — BM25 discover/reuse
contract declare "<north star>" --action sequence    # the organism root
contract spawn <root> "stage 1 ..." --budget 5       # Steps 1-6 — ordered creation
  ...                                                #            (one spawn per stage)
contract audit <root> --auditors 13                  # Step 8  — falsifier judgement
contract _mark <root> satisfied                      # Step 9  — emergence
```

Nothing here is a new engine. The genesis organ is the nine shapes, the
BM25 plan stage, and the natural-selection lifecycle — composed.

## Signal propagation (the nervous system)

A pile of cells is not an organism — what makes it one is **signalling**.
The contract graph has the cells and the edges (parent links, `contract:<id>`
references, `corroborate` synapses); signal propagation makes those edges
**fire**.

When a contract is marked satisfied — the action potential — `_mark`
surfaces the **wavefront**: every contract a change here should
re-evaluate.

```
=== PROPAGATION (signal) ===
  <id> satisfied. wavefront — judge KEY 2 on each:
  parent organ       <pid>   "<plan>"   -> contract iterate <pid>
  unblocked referrer <rid>   "<plan>"   -> contract iterate <rid>
  synapse            <sid>   "<plan>"   -> contract iterate <sid>
```

The wavefront has three conduction paths:

- **parent organ** — the funnel / sequence / quorum this contract is a
  child of may now be complete.
- **unblocked referrers** — every contract whose `--action` is
  `contract:<id>` was gated on this one; the gate just opened.
- **synapses** — contracts `corroborate`d with this one; related truths
  worth re-checking.

The substrate surfaces the wavefront; it never satisfies anything. KEY 2
stays with the agent on every contract the signal reaches. The graph is now
a nervous system that fires, not a filing cabinet that is walked by hand.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Auto-declare from a detected pattern. Surfaces candidates only.
- Auto-satisfy when the action exits 0. Agent is the second key.
- Maintain a separate principle store. `~/.contracts/contracts.jsonl` is the single store.
- Prescribe plan text format. The declarant authors it.
## Psychology (the layer biology doesn't reach)

Biology gives us cells, organs, signals, selection. Psychology adds **what
the agent can hold and act on**. /contract is a substrate at **layer L2**;
its outputs default to L2 + L3 because that's where the agent operates.
Bleed across layers is cognitive noise that erodes attention.

### The five abstraction layers

| Layer | Speaks in | Examples | Default visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0 — mechanical** | exit codes, hashes, raw paths | `action_exit=1`, `id=905c1a3a`, `pointer(cli): python3 -c "..."` | `--verbose` / `--debug` only |
| **L1 — substrate** | shape names, ledger events | `cell`, `funnel`, `iterated`, `merged` | `--verbose` |
| **L2 — agent-UX** | next action, wave count, navigation | "iterate → judge → mark", "wave 2/5" | **default ON** |
| **L3 — truth-claim** | the plan, PASS/FAIL, KEY-2 verdict | "plan: …", "result: PASS", "is this genuinely satisfied?" | **default ON** |
| **L4 — user-intent** | plain-English meaning, business goal | "frontend is now a banger", "the fix landed" | agent translates upward; skill doesn't emit |

**Rule:** every emitted line belongs to exactly one layer. Mixed-layer output
is a defect. If a layer above L3 needs to be spoken, that's the agent's job
(it has theory of mind for the user; the skill does not).

Worked corroboration: contract `900af694` (output at correct abstraction
layer), `ed084986` (layers named explicitly), `cdb648fc` (final message
/humanizer-translated).

### Three psychology defaults (genuinely distinct from biology/theology)

| # | Default | Antidote to | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ψ1** | **Layer purity.** Output one layer at a time; L0 noise is hidden by default. | layer-bleed cognitive load | this section + `--verbose` flag on noisy verbs |
| **Ψ2** | **Working-memory cap (Miller's 7±2).** The "When to invoke" front-door table caps at ≤8 load-bearing rows. Long-tail verbs are discoverable via `contract self`, not crammed into entry. | front-door overflow | self-test invariant `psych/working-memory-cap` |
| **Ψ3** | **Confirmation-bias antidote.** For any organ with **≥3 children**, run `contract audit <id>` before `_mark satisfied` — N cold falsifiers try to break it. The substrate surfaces the prompt; the agent judges whether to honor it. | motivated reasoning / fake-green | propagation block after every funnel iterate that surfaces "audit recommended (N children)" |

These do not replace the engineering/theology defaults — they layer on top.
Where biology says "an organism is satisfied when all children fire", psychology
says "the agent reading that result is constrained — render it at L3, not L0,
and cap at one chunk." Where theology says "no false witness", psychology
says "the agent will rationalize fake-green without an external auditor —
fan one out before marking."


The substrate enables; it does not prescribe. Scripts emit evidence only. No script bakes a verdict, a banned list, or a per-case rule. The agent renders every verdict in-thread. A contract that auto-satisfies is a tautology, not a contract.

## Ledger schema

`~/.contracts/contracts.jsonl` — append-only, agent-agnostic. One JSON line per event. Lives outside `.claude/` and `.codex/` so contracts survive across runtimes.

```json
{"event":"declared",  "id":"abc1", "plan":"...", "action":"...", "pointer_type":"cli", "parent_id":null, "ts":"..."}
{"event":"iterated",  "id":"abc1", "wave":1, "action_exit":1, "action_result":"fail", "agent_verdict":null, "children_spawned":[], "ts":"..."}
{"event":"iterated",  "id":"abc1", "wave":2, "action_exit":0, "action_result":"pass", "agent_verdict":"genuine", "ts":"..."}
{"event":"satisfied", "id":"abc1", "wave":2, "ts":"..."}
{"event":"spawned",   "id":"abc2", "parent_id":"abc1", "plan":"...", "action":"...", "ts":"..."}
```

The ledger is memory. Every failed wave is `learn_from_execution`. Never delete rows.

## Pointer principle

A contract's `--action` is always a **pointer** to a capability, not raw data inline. The pointer tells the system WHERE to find the check; never embeds the logic itself.

Pointer types that aren't shapes (shapes are catalogued above):

| Pointer type | `--action` form | What it points to |
|---|---|---|
| `cli` | `npm test`, `python3 verify.py` | A local executable or shell command |
| `api` | `curl https://...`, `https://...` | An HTTP endpoint |
| `contract-ref` | `contract:<id>` | Another contract's satisfaction status |

The `contract:<id>` form is pointer-to-pointer: the action is satisfied when the referenced contract is satisfied. This lets one contract's truth claim depend on another without embedding any logic.

The ledger records every pointer call as a row (`event: iterated`), so you always have a history of what was queried, when, and what it returned. The ledger IS the query history.

Rules:
- Never hardcode a decision inside `--action`. The action checks; it never decides.
- If the check requires a server or API, the pointer is the URL; the server holds the logic.
- A `contract:<id>` pointer resolves the referenced contract's current status from the ledger — it does not re-run the action; it reads the declared truth.
- `pointer_type` is stored on every `declared` row and returned by `get()`. It is evidence for the agent, not a baked verdict.
- Actions are bound to their declare-time working directory. `contract_core.declare()` records `cwd` on every row; `iterate` runs the action from it (rows predating the field fall back to the current directory). Declare a contract from the directory its action should run in, and a relative-path action stays correct even when iterated later from elsewhere. Do not bake `cd <dir> &&` into an action.


## Concept lineage (genesis .tongues)

| Tongues doctrine | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `CONTRACTING_IS_LEARNING` — contracts encode lessons | The ledger IS memory. Failed waves are `learn_from_execution`. |
| `AUTO_CONTRACT_HABIT_DETECTION` / `DAEMON_INTERFACE` — patterns surface as candidates; substrate watches and routes | `contract search` surfaces; agent declares. |
| `self_grow` — spawn children | `contract spawn` is this primitive made real. |

From `principles-as-harnesses.md`: a principle with `--action` IS a contract. From `dag-schema.md`: the graph is the single substrate. These are not external dependencies; they are the concept lineage this primitive implements directly.

See also `references/agentic-ux-copilot.md` for the standing-default doctrine: every `/contract`-built site with a web UI embeds an agentic copilot whose tools are the site's own indexed APIs and whose knowledge is the site's own page content — the same truth-telling discipline as the primitive, applied to the end user.

## Bundled scripts

- `scripts/contract` — CLI front door (declare, iterate, build, spawn, solve, status, list, search, _mark)
- `scripts/contract-habit-detect.py` — passive related-contract detector (L2; surfaced via `contract search`)
- `scripts/contract-import-extract.py` — import extractor: surfaces past patterns as candidate contracts (L2)
- `scripts/check-no-silent-fallback.py` — guard: fails if any skill script swallows an error silently
- `scripts/lib/contract_core.py` — data model, sole ledger writer (L0)
- `scripts/contract-crystallize.py` — crystallizes a learning into a memory file + an Outline doc (shared by the `learn` verb and the crystallize-learning hook)
- `~/.contracts/hooks/crystallize-learning.py` — internal hook: on every `mark` event, crystallizes a satisfied learning-bearing contract
- `~/.contracts/contracts.jsonl` — the single append-only store (agent-agnostic)
